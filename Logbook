18 april
Change of supervisor

19 april
First meeting with Stratis, agreed on basic idea

20 april
Watched lecture 1 of David Silver's Reinformcement Learning Course
Read paper about deep reinforcement learning in Chess
Went to lecture about deep learning in computervision

21 and 22 april
Worked out presentation and overall plan and idea. Wrote and submitted proposal

26 april
Meeting with supervisors

26 - 28 april
Watched David Silver lectures t/m 6

29 april
Looked up existing chess implementations and decided to implement my own

1 may 
Wrote representation of chess

2 may
Installed Theano and lasagne and read about both
Meeting with Stratis. Plan: implement a rough network for a basic gridworld example
Worked on the implementation with Laurens

3 may
Meeting with supervisors
Worked on the implementation with Laurens
Read more of atari paper

4 may
Worked on the implementation with Laurens
Parameters did not update

5 may
Copied code of Laurens. Found out parameters do slightly update, but gradients are very small
Watched lecture 7 of David Silver
Wrote supervisors for any help

6 may - 7 may
Tried to fix the problem with the gradients
Read notes of course Leren
Read Giraffe paper (reinforcement learning chess) and understood their idea
Sent mail to supervisor

9 may
Spoke with Berkay about problem
Spoke with Stratis, he explained basics of gradient decent
Cleaned up code

10 may
Understood gradient descent in reinforcement learning
King learned to move up by doing random moves
Still zero gradients with predicted move
Spoke with Changyong

11 may
Meeting with supervisors
Sat down with Stratis and found a problem with output network
Implemented ideas from meeting
Zero gradient problem solved
King quickly learns to move up the board

12 may
Made sure king doesn't move off the board
Fixed error from the day before
Cleaned up theano functions

13 may
Laptop died
Read back my notes of David Silver's course

14 may
Read back my notes of David Silver's course
Started on the Deep Learning course of Oxford

15 may
Finished the Deep Learning course of Oxford
Bought a new laptop and installed programming environment
Added terminal state and got rid of immediate rewards
Added illegal moves and another king
King avoids other king with only one reward at end of episode
