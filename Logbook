Change of supervisor

19 april
First meeting with Stratis, agreed on basic idea

20 april
Watched lecture 1 of David Silver's Reinformcement Learning Course
Read paper about deep reinforcement learning in Chess
Went to lecture about deep learning in computervision

21 and 22 april
Worked out presentation and overall plan and idea. Wrote and submitted proposal

26 april
Meeting with supervisors

26 - 28 april
Watched David Silver lectures t/m 6

29 april
Looked up existing chess implementations and decided to implement my own

1 may 
Wrote representation of chess

2 may
Installed Theano and lasagne and read about both
Meeting with Stratis. Plan: implement a rough network for a basic gridworld example
Worked on the implementation with Laurens

3 may
Meeting with supervisors
Worked on the implementation with Laurens
Read more of atari paper

4 may
Worked on the implementation with Laurens
Parameters did not update

5 may
Copied code of Laurens. Found out parameters do slightly update, but gradients are very small
Watched lecture 7 of David Silver
Wrote supervisors for any help

6 may - 7 may
Tried to fix the problem with the gradients
Read notes of course Leren
Read Giraffe paper (reinforcement learning chess) and understood their idea
Sent mail to supervisor

9 may
Spoke with Berkay about problem
Spoke with Stratis, he explained basics of gradient decent
Cleaned up code

10 may
Understood gradient descent in reinforcement learning
King learned to move up by doing random moves
Still zero gradients with predicted move
Spoke with Changyong

11 may
Meeting with supervisors
Sat down with Stratis and found a problem with output network
Implemented ideas from meeting
Zero gradient problem solved
King quickly learns to move up the board

12 may
Made sure king doesn't move off the board
Fixed error from the day before
Cleaned up theano functions

13 may
Laptop died
Read back my notes of David Silver's course

14 may
Read back my notes of David Silver's course
Started on the Deep Learning course of Oxford

15 may
Finished the Deep Learning course of Oxford
Bought a new laptop and installed programming environment
Added terminal state and got rid of immediate rewards
Added illegal moves and another king
King avoids other king with only one reward at end of episode

16 may
Evaluated the learning process
Added a pawn

17 may
Meeting with supervisors

18 - 20
Trouble with evaluating the learning process
Wrote evaluation methods
Wrote a method to save the paramaters of the neural network
Added the replay memory

23 may
Academic writing course

24 may
Meeting with supervisors
Tested on the most basic situations

25 may
Found out that epsilon descreasing was necessary to learn.
Agent was able to learn with random initialisation of pawn an king positions on 8 x 8 board

26 may
Prepared the midterm presentation

27 may
Midterm presentation
Learned pycharm
Changed the way the agent is handling illegal moves

28 and 29 may
Wrote the first version of the literature overview

30 may
Made the other king move too
Saved evaluation methods
Connected to Das4

31 may
Meeting with supervisors

1 and 2 june
Transformed the loss to being able to cope with batches.

3 june
Cleaned up my whole chess implementation and fixed bugs
Added stalemate

4 june
Made a nice representation of the chess board

5 june
Improved the literature overview

6 june
Academic writing course
Improved the literature overview

7 june
Meeting with supervisors
Started adding SunFish

8 june
Encoded my representation to that of SunFish and from SunFish back to mine.

9 june
Connected with Gaviota, the endgame tablebase
Wrote the evaluation method to fit in Gaviota.

10 june
Wrote the introduction

13 june
experimented and improved results

14 june
Meeting with supervisors.
Division KPK into different levels.
Thought of a division.

15 june
Adapted evaluation methods to fit with different levels of KPK endgames.
Started writing the Methods part of the thesis

16 june
Continued writing Method part
Meeting with Eion to discuss my English.

17 june
Finished the Method section
Wrote the Discussion and Conclusion and made an outline for the results section

18 june
Wrote the results section
Added graphs and figures in Latex
Read the whole thing and added introductions to each section.

19 june
Improved the Latex document with prettier plots and figures.
Added acknowledgements and front page.
Edited language mistakes etc.
Printed out my first version

20 june
Read the whole thing and corrected mistakes
Made references to all tables and figures
Sent the first version to my supervisors

21 june
